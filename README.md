# Smart-social-networks-Project

CMPE 281: Cloud Technologies Project

Platform and Technologies:
We are using the Open Source Social Network (OSSN) platform to enable social networking and forums for discussion. Users can discuss topics and get their questions solved and also participate in answering questions. All of these things are recorded and tracked so that students can build up a reputation score that they can surface to company recruiters and other compete with one another
